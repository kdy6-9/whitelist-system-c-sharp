							**#A simple IP-based whitelist system for your c# application(s). 

		Although it works for what it's intended for, a simple reverse-engineering program could show anyone the IP (s) that you have placed in the lines of code. 
		Many alternative solutions to this system are more secure but more complicated to implement. This is the "bottom of the barrel" of whitelist systems if you 
  	will.

		Use this in any way you wish to, but you would be accepting the risks of getting your IP possibly grabbed by doing so. I do not take any blame for any of the 
  	damages that could be caused by something like that.

		Hope it helps in a way.**
